# My Emacs config

Inspired by https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d and https://gitcafe.com/Leaflet/.emacs.d/ and others.  Uses [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package).

If, for some reason I cannot fathom, you want to try out my Emacs configuration, run these commands. First you'll move your existing Emacs configuration out of the way, then you'll clone mine.

    $ mv .emacs .emacs.BAK
	$ mv .emacs.d .emacs.d.BAK
	$ git clone https://github.com/wdenton/.emacs.d.git
	$ emacs

When you run Emacs it will probably spend a while downloading and installing packages. It may complain some are missing.  That's all right. When it's done, close it (Ctrl-X Ctrl-C) and then restart.  You'll be left with an Emacs that runs just like mine.
